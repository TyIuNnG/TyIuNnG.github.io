            <h3 style="font-size:large;"><u>Week 2</u></h3>

            <b>Question 1: What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</b>

            <p>The first thing that I paid attention to is the liquid effect that corresponds to where my mouse cursor is pointing at.</p>

            <b>Question 2: Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</b>

            <p>The first thing I did was moving my mouse cursor around and make the screen a mess. Later on, I noticed there's a selection bar on the top of the page that I clicked then noticed it brings me to other cool work. But because it's no longer the liquid entropy page, so I jumped back to the page and try to mess with the controls on the right hand side. The first control I tried is to turn on the refraction/reverb feature. It made the liquid effect looks much smoother. Next, I tried the slide controls from top of the list to the bottom.</p>

            <b>Question 3: What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</b>

            <p>I spent most of the time engaging with drawing effect on screen, because it is quite satisfying when flooding the screen with the liquid effect, it sort of forms a complicated shape that is not usually an easy thing to replicate.</p>

            <b>Question 4: What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</b>

            <p>The most common action in the two minute interaction would be moving the cursor to create liquid effects.</p>

            <b>Question 5: What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</b>

            <p>My impression of the intended primary goal of this liquid entropy interaction is to draw out people's creativity and curiosity.</p>

            <b>Question 6: What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</b>

            <p>I think the experience draws out people's creativity and curiosity because people will try to mess around with drawing different stuff on the screen to create different unique images. People will try out different settings of controls to make the screen beautiful or chaotic.</p>

            <b>Question 7: What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</b>

            <p>This experience should be able to be interacted for least like half to one hour for once.</p>

            <b>Question 8: What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</b>

            <p>It should be interacted that way because the experience itself does not have much features, so it would be hard for people like me to vist it the second time since there's nothing else I can do except messing around with the screen for a few more minutes after finished exploring the controls.</p>

            <h4 style="font-size:large;"><u>Week 3</u></h4>

            <b>Question 9: What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</b>

            <p>I think this experience is referenceing a painting software.</p>

            <b>Question 10: What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?</b>

            <p>This reference of painting software suggests that I should adjust the mouse size just like a brush or many other controls that are similar to brush controls, then draw whatever I like on the big canva.</p>

            <b>Question 11: What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</b>

            <p>This reference of painting software suggests that when engaging with it, I should feel free to try anything, draw anything and feel happy and satisfied when looking at the results.</p>
            <b>Question 12: What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</b>

            <p>One frustrating element of the interactions is that during fast movements, the liquid entropy effect will look very unnatural, even when the reverb options is ticked which smoothen the effect a bit. To be more precise, I think the way it tracks the users' cursor is by an interval amount of time, which is a very often used technique. What happens with this technique is that it generates the movement not by lines but dots that line up close enough that they would look like a line. However, in fast movements there will always be large gaps being left over which ends up ruining the liquid effect.</p>

            <b>Question 13: What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</b>

            <p>The most satisfying element I think would be the controls for zoom/turbo. The reason for it being satisfying is that it is not realistic at all. The definition for that feature is basically pointing a camera towards liquid and changing the lenses while trying to make the liquid effect. The zoom/turbo is basically something that we can't witness with eyes only, that is why it is very satisfying for this interaction to be able to present such things that we can't usually see.</p>
